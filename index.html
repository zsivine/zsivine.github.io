Welcome! My name is Paul and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie in financial economics. I've researched how banks cause credit frictions to the real economy, how they interact with regulators and how their CEOs/CFOs words can be used to proxy the uncertainty banks face. Helping me along the way, I've been learning how to apply recent techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to these economic problems. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> and my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!
