<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Banks differ from non-financial firms as they must communicate to both regulators and shareholders, possess opaque and complex balance sheets, and are the main providers of credit to the real economy. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the <i>idiosyncratic uncertainty</i> banks face at the bank-quarter level. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index spikes at the during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and higher trading, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game. Using loan-level data and firm-fixed effects, I control for credit demand and find higher bank-level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter.</p>

<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>
