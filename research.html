<strong>Breaking the Word Bank: Effects of Verbal Uncertainty on Bank Behavior</strong> (Job Market Paper)<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Banks differ from non-financial firms as they must communicate to both regulators and shareholders, possess opaque and complex balance sheets, and are the main providers of credit to the real economy. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the <i>idiosyncratic uncertainty</i> banks face at the bank-quarter level. The index uses a recent natural language processing technique, called Skip-gram Model, to discover a novel list of "uncertainty" words based on semantic and syntactic similarities. I use the frequencies of these words in banks quarterly conference calls as a proxy for bank-level uncertainty. The index spikes at the beginning of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and larger securities portfolios, suggesting active management of uncertainty by moving from lending to holding liquid assets. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of higher aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game.</p>

<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Widespread government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may embezzle information. To identify window-dressing to supervisors, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease riskier securities and loans, and also overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit. All effects are stronger for reviewed banks with higher trading book activity. Overall, results suggest that banks window-dress in supervisory audits, especially on their liquid assets which are easy to change fast.</p><br>
