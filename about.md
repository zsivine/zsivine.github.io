I am currently a staff machine learning researcher at Qualcomm AI Research. In July 2017, I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Irvine, under the guidance of Prof. Jack Xin. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics, followed by a Master's in Computational Mathematics from Shandong University, China. During my studies, I interned at Black Knight Financial Services and the data science team at Zillow. While pursuing my PhD, I collaborated on a research project with Qualcomm's computer vision team, which led me to join the group after graduation. My research now focuses on Segmentations, Detections, Foundation models, Multi-modality AI and Optmiation on Edge-AI and Hybrid-AI.
