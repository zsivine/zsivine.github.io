I am currently a senior machine learning engineer at Qualcomm AI Research. 
In July 2018, I finished my PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Irvine, with advisor Prof. Jack Xin. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and then a Master's degree of Computational Mathemtics from Shandong University, China. Previously, I did internships in Black Knight Financial Services and in data scientist team of Zillow. During my PhD, I joined a research project cooperated with Qualcomm computer vision team and after graduation, I joint that group to continue my research:  applied mathematics and optimization on the Edge, like mobile and IoT devices.
