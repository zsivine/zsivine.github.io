I am currently a staff machine learning researcher at the Computer Vision team of Qualcomm AI Research. 
In July 2017, I finished my PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Irvine, with advisor Prof. Jack Xin. 
I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and then a Master's degree of Computational Mathematics from Shandong University, China. 
Previously, I did internships in Black Knight Financial Services and in data scientist team of Zillow. 
During my PhD study, I joined a research project cooperated with Qualcomm computer vision team. 
After graduation, I joined that group to continue my research:  applied mathematics and optimization on the Edge devices.
